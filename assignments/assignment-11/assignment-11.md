Reflections on the CHAOSS Podcast:
----------------------------------
  It was interesting to hear everyone's different backgrounds in a field that has only recently become reasonably well known. Specifically, the passion the members had for OSS communities and or metrics paired with the real need for understanding from a business perspective highlighted the importance of this project.
  
  I found the section discussing getting involved in CHAOSS particularly interesting. The fact that to be involved you don't have to have any kind of computing or coding experience didn't make sense at first. However, it became clear the importance of all kinds of community involvement in discussions of metrics needed, classification of metrics, metric viability, etc. This was a direct bridge to what seems to be the purpose of this course: bridging the gap between business and tech for the betterment of both fields.
